# OperatingSystem
Developed critical operating system components using C++

The OS that I developed focuses primarily on three main areas.
1. File system
2. Memory system
3. Process control block

For testing purposes, I developed some basic c++ programs to test the functionality of these systems. They are identified with the Test key. 
Along with this, I have started integrating them together with my shell which operates in a similiar fashion to the linux or windows shell you may be used to. Please look at my BasicShell.cpp to check the various commands my operating system supports.
